# VRP-formulations

This is a repository for different VRP formulations

CVRP: is an initial approach to a Gurobipy formulation

CVRP II: is the formulation as written in the investigation proposal

HFMDCVRP: first multi-attribute model with multiple depots and heterogeneous fleet

CVRP Efficient: same problem as in CVRP II but with a different formulation. Optimal is found in less than 60 seconds

PCVRP: modelation of a periodic CVRP
