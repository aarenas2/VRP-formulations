# VRP-formulations

This is a repository for different VRP formulations

CVRP: is an initial approach to a Gurobipy formulation

CVRP II: is the formulation as written in the investigation proposal

CVRP Efficient: same problem as in CVRP II but with a different formulation. Optimal is found in less than 60 seconds

PCVRP: modelation of a periodic CVRP

HFMDCVRP: first multi-attribute model with multiple depots and heterogeneous fleet

HFMDCVRP cap depo: the capacity of the depot is not the number of vehicles it can attend but the amount of demand

HFMDCVRP u_ij: variable u_ij is to know in which position an arc is visited
